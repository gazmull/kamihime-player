# Kamihime Player (NodeJS)

This is the Node.JS port of Eliont's Player ([Kamihime Player Offline](https://harem-battle.club/kamihime-project/3605-love-scenes-collecting.html))

# How to Use
### Requires at least [Node 8](https://nodejs.org) and Scripts builder: [kh-snek#scripts-offline](https://github.com/gazmull/kh-snek/tree/scripts-offline)
* `$ git clone https://github.com/gazmull/kamihime-player.git`
* `$ cd kamihime-player`
* `$ npm install`
* Please ensure that you've done the scripts builder portion, which was linked above.
* `$ node .`
* See `http://localhost` to start browsing.

# Finally
* Please use this wisely.
* If you liked the game's scenes (or somehow; most of them are cheesy anyway :lul:), support the developers!
